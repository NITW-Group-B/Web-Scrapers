putting together some code 
David's progress:
    I can get a regular html file to be scrapable
    I can't get a ashx file to be scrapable despite 2 compilable attempts and a 3rd uncompilable to connect 

    for a scrapable site:
        https://www.cruisemapper.com/wiki/759-how-much-does-a-cruise-ship-cost
            We want to get certain tags:
                table table-striped, 
                table row style height: 37px;


questions for analytics teams:
    what data from each site are we looking for
    https://www.cruisemapper.com/wiki/759-how-much-does-a-cruise-ship-cost
    how do you want it presented?

questions for dashboard team:

    how do you want it presented?


workflow
get trees from the finite (hopefully) links
look on certain branches for each tree for data we want
collect the data in a representation
send the representation to the other teams

pair programing commit message
"Fred Wang, Morgan Precanico, David Tauraso
main commit message"

We are using github desktop instead

jscode with Java is giving serious project issues
    it doesn't recognize there is a project to edit and rerun
    mine can only rerun the last time it was saved
    We are using Morgan's computer as it can run the java correctly
    Also using liveshare made it helpful to allow the other users to contribute regardless of the issues with Maven environment
