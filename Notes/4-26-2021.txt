putting together some code 
David's progress:
    I can get a regular html file to be scrapable
    I can't get a ashx file to be scrapable despite 2 compilable attempts and a 3rd uncompilable to connect 

    for a scrapable site:
        https://www.cruisemapper.com/wiki/759-how-much-does-a-cruise-ship-cost
            We want to get certain tags:
                table table-striped, 
                table row style height: 37px;
    
questions for analytics teams:
    what data from each site are we looking for
    https://www.cruisemapper.com/wiki/759-how-much-does-a-cruise-ship-cost
    how do you want it presented?

questions for dashboard team:

    how do you want it presented?


workflow
get trees from the finite (hopefully) links
look on certain branches for each tree for data we want
collect the data in a representation
send the representation to the other teams
